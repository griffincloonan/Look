Makefile provided for compliation: make Look
Compiles with -Wall -Werror -O3 flags

This program implements the Unix 'look' command, with a few minor changes. 

Function: This command prints out all of the lines from a specified file 
 that begin with a speficied string prefix. The original look command
 assumes that the target file is already sorted but this version will
 automatically sort the file before seaching for the string prefix. 

 If no file is specified for searching, then the program will use 
 /usr/share/dict/words as the target file.

Usage: look [-df] [-t termchar] string [file ...]

-d:   Only alphanumeric characters (i.e. 0 - 9 and A - z) are compared

-f:   The case of alphabetic characters are ignored in the search string, 
      thus printing out both upper and lower case matches 

-t:   A termination character is specified and only the search string up 
      to and including that character will be searched for 
		(e.g. 
				./Look -t i pick file.txt	

				would be the same as

				./Look pi file.txt
		)
